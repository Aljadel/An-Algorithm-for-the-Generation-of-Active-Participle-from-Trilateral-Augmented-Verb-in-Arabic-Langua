# An-Algorithm-for-the-Generation-of-Active-Participle-from-Trilateral-Augmented-Verb-in-Arabic-Langua

 This study focused on issues of Arabic morphology which is  the Generation of Active Participle from Trilateral Augmented Verb in Arabic Language Words based on perception cognition of traditionalist linguists, mechanisms of morphological generation software and tools of automated processing of human languages. The Active Participle in the Holy Quran were chosen as a study corpus, and then the grammatical rules of the Active Participle were collected from the old and modern Arabic morphological books. The rules of the Active Participle were described and tagged in an accurate way. In order to build a computational algorithm to generate the Active Participle from Trilateral Augmented Verb. The final product was an Arabic morphological Generator of Active Participle from Trilateral Augmented Verb in Arabic Language.
